## What is this?
This is a port of the game [Highway Blossoms](https://vnstudioelan.itch.io/highway-blossoms) 
using the framework [Portmaster](https://portmaster.games/). This does not include
any game files, but with them you should be able to play the game on some handheld devices
such as 

## How do I use it? 
drop the entire contents of the 'Highway\ Blossoms\ 1.2.5\ -\ Unified/' folder
provided by buying the game on itch.io and then run the `./Highway Blossoms.sh`
script to start it.

## Things to note!
* The first time you run the game, it will take a while to start, like 15 minutes.
this is because the first thing it does is downsample all the assets so that
the videos don't play like slide shows and the images don't take up quite as much
RAM

* The menu interaction is a little weird in the base game with just keyboard,
so similarly it is a little wonky on the gamepad navigating some of the menus,
but it does work.
